# End-point assessment plan

## Introduction and overview

This document explains the requirements for end-point assessment (EPA) for the digital and technology solutions professional degree-apprenticeship. End-point assessment organisations (EPAOs) must follow this when designing and delivering the EPA.

Digital and technology solutions professional apprentices, their employers and training providers should read this document.

A degree-apprenticeship awards a degree with the achievement of the apprenticeship. The degree learning outcomes must be aligned with the knowledge, skills and behaviours (KSBs) in the apprenticeship. The degree must be completed, passed and awarded alongside the digital and technology solutions professional degree-apprenticeship.

The apprentice must complete their training and meet the gateway requirements before starting their EPA. The EPA will assess occupational competence.

A degree-apprenticeship must be delivered by a Higher Education Provider (HEP) that is on both the register of apprenticeship training providers (RoATP) and the register of end-point assessment organisations (RoEPAO). The apprentice's employer must select an HEP who is on both registers.

If the HEP is using a credit framework, the EPA must contribute to the total credit value, and must be delivered in line with this EPA plan. However, the number of credits devoted to EPA may vary across HEP’s. The recommended EPA contribution is 30 credits of the total credit value.

A full-time digital and technology solutions professional apprentice typically spends 48 months on-programme (this means in training before the gateway). The apprentice must spend at least 12 months on-programme and complete the required amount of off-the-job training in line with the apprenticeship funding rules.

This EPA should then be completed within an EPA period lasting typically 48 months.

Occupational competence is outlined by the EPA grade descriptors and determined, when assessed in line with this EPA plan, by an independent assessor who is an occupational expert and confirms the overall EPA grade.

Assessment method 1 - project report with presentation, questions and answers:

  - > fail

<!-- end list -->

  - > pass

<!-- end list -->

  - > distinction

Assessment method 2 - professional discussion underpinned by a portfolio:

  - > fail

<!-- end list -->

  - > pass

<!-- end list -->

  - > distinction

The result from each assessment method is combined to decide the overall degree-apprenticeship grade. The following grades are available for the degree-apprenticeship:

  - > fail

<!-- end list -->

  - > pass

<!-- end list -->

  - > merit

**Duration of end-point assessment period**

The EPA is taken in the EPA period. The EPA period starts when the EPAO confirms the gateway requirements have been met and is typically 3 months.

The EPAO should confirm the gateway requirements have been met and the EPA should start as quickly as possible.

**EPA gateway**

The apprentice’s employer must be content that the apprentice has attained sufficient KSBs to complete the degree-apprenticeship. The employer may take advice from the apprentice's training provider, but the employer must make the decision. The apprentice will then enter the gateway.

The apprentice must meet the gateway requirements before starting their EPA.

They must:

  - > confirm they are ready to take the EPA

  - > have achieved English and mathematics qualifications in line with the apprenticeship funding rules

<!-- end list -->

  - > have completed and passed all required elements of the Digital and Technology Solutions Professional degree-apprenticeship except the EPA

<!-- end list -->

  - > submit a Project title and summary for the project report with presentation, questions and answers

The apprentice will scope out and provide a summary of what the project will cover and will submit this to the EPAO at the gateway. This should demonstrate that the work-based project report will provide sufficient opportunity for the apprentice to meet the KSBs mapped to this method. The summary is not formally assessed and will typically be no longer than 500 words.

The project proposal needs to include a summary of the project plan, research requirements, an overview of how the project will be planned to include timeframes and the date the work-based project report must be submitted to the independent assessor taking into account the deadlines stipulated within this end-point assessment plan. The EPAO will sign off the project summary within 2 weeks of the Gateway to ensure sufficient scope to meet the KSBs mapped to this assessment method.

  - > submit a Portfolio of evidence for the professional discussion underpinned by a portfolio

• apprentices must compile a portfolio of evidence during the on-programme period of the apprenticeship

• it must contain evidence related to the KSBs that will be assessed by the professional discussion

• the portfolio of evidence will typically contain 6 discrete pieces of evidence

• evidence must be mapped against the KSBs

• evidence may be used to demonstrate more than one KSB; a qualitative as opposed to quantitative approach is suggested

• evidence sources may include:

o workplace documentation/records, for example workplace policies/procedures, records

o witness statements

o assignments

o annotated photographs

o video clips (maximum total duration 10 minutes); the apprentice must be in view and identifiable

This is not a definitive list; other evidence sources are possible.

• Although it is expected that apprentices at degree level will be reflective in their practice, it should be noted that the EPA assesses individuals on evidence of output against the KSBs, not reflective accounts or any methods of self-assessment.

• any employer contributions should focus on direct observation of performance (for example witness statements) rather than opinions

• the evidence provided must be valid and attributable to the apprentice; the portfolio of evidence must contain a statement from the employer and apprentice confirming this

• the portfolio of evidence must be submitted to the EPAO at the gateway

The portfolio of evidence is not directly assessed. It underpins the professional discussion and therefore should not be marked by the EPAO. EPAOs should review the portfolio of evidence in preparation for the professional discussion but are not required to provide feedback after this review of the portfolio.

The apprentice must submit the gateway evidence to their EPAO, including any organisation specific policies and procedures requested by the EPAO.

**Order of assessment methods**

The assessment methods can be delivered in any order.

The result of one assessment method does not need to be known before starting the next.

**Project Report with presentation, questions and answers**

**Overview**

A project involves the apprentice completing a significant and defined piece of work that has a real business application and benefit.

**NB - The project may be undertaken pre-gateway, however, the Project Report must be completed after the apprentice has gone through the gateway.**

A Digital and Technology Solutions Project may take years and not all projects experience a full life cycle, sometimes being abandoned for cost reasons or change of business strategy. A Digital Technology Solutions Professional may be one of a multidisciplined team and therefore may not control the timescale of the project. Therefore a project (or part project) cannot be designed or delayed to fit into the EPA timescale nor the specification of the EPAO as results can range from successful new recommendations on process, product or decommission. This cannot be predicted.

The project must give the apprentice the opportunity to demonstrate the KSBs mapped to this assessment method.

The project must meet the needs of the employer’s business and be relevant to the apprentice’s occupation and apprenticeship. The EPAO must confirm that it provides the apprentice with the opportunity to demonstrate the KSBs mapped to this assessment method to the highest available grade. The EPAO must refer to the grading descriptors to ensure that projects are pitched appropriately.

This assessment method has 2 components:

  - > Project with report

  - > presentation with questions and answers

**Rationale**

This assessment method is being used because a project is a fundamental activity within the sectors in which a DTSP works. Every specialism within the DTSP apprenticeship works within a project-based approach and so this is a valid way of measuring competence.

The project may be undertaken pre-gateway, however, the Project Report must be completed after the apprentice has gone through the gateway.

A Digital and Technology Solutions Project may take years and not all projects experience a full life cycle, sometimes being abandoned for cost reasons or change of business strategy. A Digital Technology Solutions Professional may be one of a multidisciplined team and therefore may not control the timescale of the project. Therefore a project (or part project) cannot be designed or delayed to fit into the EPA timescale nor the specification of the EPAO as results can range from successful new recommendations on process, product or decommission. This cannot be predicted.

**Component 1: Project with a project report**

**Delivery**

The project report with presentation, questions and answers must be structured to give the apprentice the opportunity to demonstrate the KSBs mapped to this assessment method to the highest available grade.

The apprentice’s project can be based on any of the following:

  - > a specific problem

  - > a recurring issue

  - > an idea or opportunity

To ensure the project allows the apprentice to meet the KSBs mapped to this assessment method to the highest available grade, the EPAO should sign-off the project’s title and scope at the gateway to confirm it is suitable.

The project output must be in the form of a report.

The apprentice must start the project report after the gateway. They must complete and submit the to the EPAO by the end of week report 12 of the EPA period. The employer should ensure the apprentice has the time and resources, within this period, to plan and complete their project. The apprentice must complete their project and the production of its components unaided.

The apprentice may work as part of a team to complete the project which could include technical internal or external support. However, the project report must be the apprentice’s own work and reflective of their own role and contribution. The apprentice and their employer must confirm that the project report is the apprentice’s own work when it is submitted.

The report must include at least:

  - an introduction

  - the scope of the project (including key performance indicators and stakeholder engagement)

  - how the outcomes would be achieved

  - a project plan

  - research and findings

  - project outcomes

  - recommendations and conclusions.

**The project report has a word count of 6000 words. A tolerance of 10% above or below the word count is allowed at the apprentice’s discretion. Appendices, references, and diagrams are not included in this total. The project report must map, in an appendix, how it evidences the KSBs mapped to this assessment method.**

**Component 2: Presentation with questions**

**Delivery**

In the presentation with questions the apprentice delivers a presentation to an independent assessor on a set subject. The independent assessor must ask questions following the presentation. This gives the apprentice the opportunity to demonstrate the KSBs mapped to this assessment method.

The apprentice must prepare and submit their presentation speaker notes and supporting materials presentation with questions and answers. The independent assessor must ask questions after the presentation. The presentations must include:

  - an overview of the project

  - the project scope (including key performance indicators)

  - summary of actions undertaken by the apprentice

  - project outcomes and how these were achieved

The apprentice must prepare and submit their presentation speaker notes and supporting materials to the EPAO at the same time as the report by the end of week 12 of the EPA period.

The apprentice must notify the EPAO, at that point, of any technical requirements for the presentation. During the presentation, the apprentice must have access to:

  - > presentation software

  - > a copy of the project report and presentation

  - > notes

  - > computer

The independent assessor must have at least 2 weeks to review the project output(s) and presentation speaker notes and supporting materials, to allow them to prepare questions. 

The EPAO must give the apprentices at least 14 days notice of the presentation with questions.

The apprentice must deliver their presentation to the independent assessor on a one-to-one basis.

The independent assessor must ask questions after the presentation.

The purpose of the questions is to explore and verify the apprentice’s understanding of their project area in relation to the apprenticeship standard.

The presentation and questions must last 60 minutes. This will typically include a presentation of 30 minutes and questioning lasting 30 minutes. The independent assessor can increase the total time of the presentation and questioning by up to 10%. This time is to allow the apprentice to complete their last point or respond to a question if necessary.

The independent assessor must ask at least 4 questions. They must use the questions from the EPAO’s question bank or create their own questions in-line with the EPAO’s training. Follow up questions are allowed where clarification is required.

The independent assessor must use the full time available for questioning. The independent assessor must make the grading decision. The project components must be assessed holistically by the independent assessor when they are deciding the grade.

The independent assessor must make the grading decision. The project components must be assessed holistically by the independent assessor when they are deciding the grade.

The independent assessor must keep accurate records of the assessment. They must record:

  - > the KSBs demonstrated in the report and presentation

  - > the apprentice’s answers to questions

  - > the KSBs demonstrated in answers to questions

  - > the grade achieved 

**Assessment location**

The presentation with questions must take place in a suitable venue selected by the EPAO (for example the EPAO’s or employer’s premises).The presentation with questions should take place in a quiet room, free from distractions and influence.

The presentation with questioning can be conducted by video conferencing. The EPAO must have processes in place to verify the identity of the apprentice and ensure the apprentice is not being aided.

**Question and resource development**

The EPAO must develop a purpose-built assessment specification and question bank. It is recommended this is done in consultation with employers of this occupation. The EPAO should maintain the security and confidentiality of EPA materials when consulting employers. The assessment specification and question bank must be reviewed at least once a year to ensure they remain fit-for-purpose.  

The assessment specification must be relevant to the occupation and demonstrate how to assess the KSBs mapped to this assessment method. The EPAO must ensure that questions are refined and developed to a high standard. The questions must be unpredictable. A question bank of sufficient size will support this.

The EPAO must ensure that the apprentice has a different set of questions in the case of re-sits or re-takes.

EPAO must produce the following materials to support the project report with presentation, questions and answers:

  - > independent assessor EPA materials which include:
    
      - > training materials
    
      - > administration materials
      
      - > moderation and standardisation materials
      
      - > guidance materials
      
      - > grading guidance
      
      - > question bank

  - > EPA guidance for the apprentice and the employer

The EPAO must ensure that the EPA materials are subject to quality assurance procedures including standardisation, training, and moderation.

**Professional Discussion underpinned by a portfolio**

**Overview**

In the professional discussion, an independent assessor and apprentice have a formal two-way conversation. It gives the apprentice the opportunity to demonstrate the KSBs mapped to this assessment method.

The apprentice can refer to and illustrate their answers with evidence from their portfolio of evidence.

**Rationale**

This assessment method is being used because:

  - > breadth of the core of the standard and opportunities to evidence across this throughout the duration of the programme

  - > allows the opportunity to explore depth of understanding surrounding the relevant specialist KSBs

**Delivery**

The professional discussion must be structured to give the apprentice the opportunity to demonstrate the KSBs mapped to this assessment method to the highest available grade.

An independent assessor must conduct and assess the professional discussion.

The purpose of the independent assessor's questions will be to explore the following topics and themes:

Theme A: Underlying Principles

Theme B: Technical Solutions

Theme C: Innovation & Response

Theme D: Legal, Ethics & Landscape

The EPAO must give an apprentice 14 days notice of the professional discussion.

The independent assessor must have at least 2 weeks to review the supporting documentation.

The apprentice must have access to their portfolio of evidence during the professional discussion.

The apprentice can refer to and illustrate their answers with evidence from their portfolio of evidence however, the portfolio of evidence is not directly assessed.

The professional discussion must last for 60 minutes. The independent assessor can increase the time of the professional discussion by up to 10%. This time is to allow the apprentice to respond to a question if necessary.

The independent assessor must ask at least 4 questions. Follow-up questions are allowed where clarification is required. The independent assessor must use the questions from their EPAO’s question bank or create their own questions in-line with the EPAO’s training.

The independent assessor must make the grading decision. The independent assessor must keep accurate records of the assessment. They must record:

  - > the apprentice’s answers to questions

  - > the KSBs demonstrated in answers to questions

  - > the grade achieved 

**Assessment location**

The professional discussion must take place in a suitable venue selected by the EPAO (for example the EPAO’s or employer’s premises).

The professional discussion can be conducted by video conferencing. The EPAO must have processes in place to verify the identity of the apprentice and ensure the apprentice is not being aided.

The professional discussion should take place in a quiet room, free from distractions and influence.

**Question and resource development**

The EPAO must develop a purpose-built assessment specification and question bank. It is recommended this is done in consultation with employers of this occupation. The EPAO should maintain the security and confidentiality of EPA materials when consulting employers. The assessment specification and question bank must be reviewed at least once a year to ensure they remain fit-for-purpose.

The EPAO must ensure that questions are refined and developed to a high standard. The questions must be unpredictable. A question bank of sufficient size will support this.

The EPAO must ensure that apprentice has a different set of questions in the case of re-sits or re-takes.

The EPAO must produce the following materials to support the professional discussion underpinned by a portfolio:

  - > independent assessor assessment materials which include:

<!-- end list -->

  - > training materials

  - > administration materials

  - > moderation and standardisation materials

  - > guidance materials

  - > grading guidance

  - > question bank

<!-- end list -->

  - > EPA guidance for the apprentice and the employer

**Overall EPA grading**

Performance in the EPA determines the overall grade of:

  - > fail

<!-- end list -->

  - > pass

<!-- end list -->

  - > merit

<!-- end list -->

  - > distinction

An independent assessor must individually grade the project report with presentation, questions and answers and professional discussion underpinned by a portfolio in line with this EPA plan.

The EPAO must combine the individual assessment method grades to determine the overall EPA grade.

If the apprentice fails one assessment method or more, they will be awarded an overall fail.

To achieve an overall pass, the apprentice must achieve at least a pass in all the assessment methods. To achieve an overall EPA merit, the apprentice must achieve a pass in either assessment method and a distinction in the remaining method. To achieve an overall EPA distinction, the apprentice must achieve a distinction in both assessment methods.

Grades from individual assessment methods must be combined in the following way to determine the grade of the EPA overall.

| **PROJECT REPORT WITH PRESENTATION, QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS** | **PROFESSIONAL DISCUSSION UNDERPINNED BY A PORTFOLIO** | **OVERALL GRADING** |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Fail                                                        | Any grade                                              | Fail                |
| Any grade                                                   | Fail                                                   | Fail                |
| Pass                                                        | Pass                                                   | Pass                |
| Pass                                                        | Distinction                                            | Merit               |
| Distinction                                                 | Pass                                                   | Merit               |
| Distinction                                                 | Distinction                                            | Distinction         |

**Re-sits and re-takes**

If the apprentice fails one or more assessment methods they can take a re-sit or a re-take at their employer’s discretion. The apprentice’s employer needs to agree that a re-sit or re-take is appropriate. A re-sit does not need further learning, whereas a re-take does.

The apprentice should have a supportive action plan to prepare for a re-sit or a re-take.

The employer and EPAO agree the timescale for a re-sit or re-take. A re-sit is typically taken within 3 months of the EPA outcome notification. The timescale for a re-take is dependent on how much re-training is required and is typically taken within 6 months of the EPA outcome notification.

If the apprentice fails the project assessment method, they must amend the project output in line with the independent assessor’s feedback. The apprentice will be given 4 weeks to rework and submit the amended report.

Failed assessment methods must be re-sat or re-taken within a 6-month period from the EPA outcome notification, otherwise the entire EPA will need to be re-sat or re-taken in full.

Re-sits and re-takes are not offered to an apprentice wishing to move from pass to a higher grade.

The apprentice will get a maximum EPA grade of merit for a re-sit or re-take, unless the EPAO determines there are exceptional circumstances.

**Reasonable adjustments**

The EPAO must have reasonable adjustments arrangements for the EPA.

This should include:

  - > how an apprentice qualifies for reasonable adjustment

  - > what reasonable adjustments may be made

Adjustments must maintain the validity, reliability and integrity of the EPA as outlined in this EPA plan.

**Internal quality assurance**

Internal quality assurance refers to the strategies, policies and procedures that EPAOs must have in place to ensure valid, consistent and reliable end-point assessment decisions.

EPAOs for this EPA must adhere to all requirements within the roles and responsibilities table and:

  - > appoint independent assessors who also:
    
      - > have relevant experience of the occupation to at least occupational level 6 gained in the last 3 years

**Value for money**

Affordability of the EPA will be aided by using at least some of the following:

  - > utilising digital remote platforms to conduct applicable assessment methods

<!-- end list -->

  - > using the employer’s premises

<!-- end list -->

  - > conducting assessment methods on the same day

**Professional recognition**

This degree-apprenticeship aligns with:

  - > British Computer Society for Registered IT Technician (RITTech)
